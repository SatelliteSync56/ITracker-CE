The index files for ITracker are basic text files and can be edited with any text editor (e.g. Notepad).

The first and second lines are not used by the program. UPCs start reading on line 3:

1|Not Used
2|Not Used
3|First UPC or First Page

To create a new page, place a blank line where a UPC would be, followed by "<PAGE>", then the page name.

In the following example, line 3 is a UPC, line 4 is line number (3 digits), SKU (4-6 digits), and department (3 digits),
lines 5-7 are a page structure:

3|760263529365
4|001 123456 999
5|
6|<PAGE>
7|Name of the page.
